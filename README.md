# Brew Convert

When browsing brewing recipes I encounter pages which are entirely imperial and heading off to another page or app to convert units was getting tedious. Enter *Brew Convert* which does the required conversions in the context menu on the page. No longer do you have to leave the page, just highlight the number and unit, and the conversion will  show when you right click on the page. No units? Brew Converter will convert the number between some of the most common units 

* Liters <-> Gallons(US)
* mg <-> oz
* kg <-> lbs
* Celcius <-> Fahrenheit
