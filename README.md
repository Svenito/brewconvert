# Brew Convert

When browsing brewing recipes I encounter pages which are entirely imperial and heading off to another page or app to convert units was getting tedious. Enter *Brew Convert* which does the required conversions in the context menu on the page. No longer do you have to leave the page, just highlight the number and unit, and the conversion will show when you right click on the page. No units selected? Brew Converter will convert the number between some of the most common units. Configure to only convert imperial to metric or vice versa, or do both each time.

* Liters <-> Gallons(US)
* mg <-> oz
* kg <-> lbs
* Celcius <-> Fahrenheit
* EBC <-> Lovibond
