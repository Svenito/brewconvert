BrewConvert
===========

Handy context menu based unit converter for common homebrew units. When browsing sites
that are either in imperial or metric units, you can now easily see the conversion
in the context menu.

Once you've installed the addon highlight a unit and right click. If you include the
unit in the selection, the add-on will try to detect the unit and convert between it
and its metric/imperial equivalent. Otherwise it will take the number and convert
between all known conversions.

Currently known units:

* oz <-> g
* lbs <-> kg
* liter <-> gallon (US)
* Celcius <-> Fahrenheit
